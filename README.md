# Data_Processing_Hadoop_Pyspark
Log data processing using Hadoop and Pyspark

## Project Overview
This project illustrates the creation of a scalable data pipeline for processing and analyzing log data with Hadoop, PySpark, and HDFS. It is tailored to manage large volumes of log files, providing insights into user behavior, error rates, and peak traffic periods for a hypothetical e-commerce platform.

## Features
- Data Ingestion: Efficiently loads log data into HDFS for scalable storage.
- Data Processing with PySpark: Conducts filtering, aggregation, and transformation operations using PySpark.
- Partitioning and Optimization: Implements partitioning strategies to enhance performance.
- Data Visualization: Creates visual representations of processed data using Python.
- Error Handling and Monitoring: Incorporates error detection and real-time monitoring mechanisms.
